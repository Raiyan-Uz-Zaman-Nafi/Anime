    <h1>Jujutsu kaisen</h1>
    <p>Jujutsu Kaisen (呪術廻戦, lit. "Sorcery Fight") is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Gege Akutami, serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump since March 2018. The individual chapters of Jujutsu Kaisen are collected and published by Shueisha, with fifteen tankōbon volumes released as of March 2021. The story follows high school student Yuji Itadori as he joins a secret organization of Jujutsu Sorcerers in order to kill a powerful Curse named Ryomen Sukuna, of whom Yuji becomes the host. The series is a sequel to a four-chapter monthly series called Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School, which was published in Shueisha's Jump GIGA from April to July 2017, and was later released under the title Jujutsu Kaisen 0 in December 2018.

        Jujutsu Kaisen is licensed for English-language release in North America by Viz Media and publishes the manga in print since December 2019. Shueisha publishes the series in English on the Manga Plus app and website. Two light novels written by Ballad Kitaguni have been released under the Jump J-Books imprint on May 2019 and January 2020, respectively. A 24-episode anime television series adaptation produced by MAPPA aired on MBS from October 2020 to March 2021. The anime is licensed by Crunchyroll for streaming outside of Asia, who premiered an English dub in November 2020. The original soundtrack of the anime will be released in April 2021.</p>
